# Untitled RPG Game
The RPG Game that nobody cares about

## What is this repo for?
Archival: so people can get old versions of this mess. And laugh at me because, oh boy, this codebase is a MESS.

## What version are you at?
0.5.0 Prealpha. Working on a patch to bring in the features I promised.

## How... messy is this codebase?
Believe me, you don't wanna even TOUCH this. I had no idea what a class even WAS when I started coding this. And I still have a long way to go...

## If you ever fix the codebase, can I use it commercially?
Apache License. Yes. Just don't upload the whole game and call it your own.

## When will it be done?
Quoting myself here: IT WILL BE DONE WHEN IT'S **DONE**. No more, no less.
