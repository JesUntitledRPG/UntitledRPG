# UntitledRPG
The Untitled RPG Game that nobody cares about
# What's this repo for?
Version archiving: so you can laugh at me like a maniac.
# Can I use this commercially?
I won't allow it, but considering how messy my code is, you wouldn't want to do it EVEN if I allowed it.
# What version is the game currently at?
0.3.1 pre-alpha. 0.4.0'll add new enemies, and IF I MANAGE TO, new combat mechanics.
# So this is a sloppily coded, unfun, made by a random guy who still doesn't know what a pointer is, role playing game.
Yep.
# When is it going to be done?
Probably never.
