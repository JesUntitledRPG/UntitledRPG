# UntitledRPG
A currently untitled RPG game. It's fully open source, made in python, and REEEEAAALLLYYY messy. Beware the spaghetti code. Also, please don't think the code is for commercial use, DON'T. PLEASE.  I actually want to make a fully fledged game, and when it's done, pull a shapez, so don't use the code commercially. (not that you'd want to...)
