## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the vulnerability is:
- present in versions prior to Rewrite 2 (0.6.0 Prealpha)
- is present in versions that haven't undergone certain recent/semirecent major changes
- present in versions that have no community presence and aren't new/seminew
- AND has been caused by my own code:
  
It won't be patched on those versions. Future versions will be patched, no doubt, but I recommend patching those yourself. If a good enough patch works, a release of that version with that vulnerability patched out may be released using a community patch, crediting those who worked on it on the credits.

If the vulnerability:
- has nothing to do with Untitled RPG Game, but with a library Untitled RPG Game uses, even if it's in an older version

then;
- Report to the library maintainers.
- Check if there are any branches of that library that have that vulnerability already patched out or a workaround for the vulnerability.
- Inform The Untitled Team of the vulnerability.

The libraries will be updated or the workarounds will be applied to versions with a checkmark. [Newest, LTS, Community Importance]

If the vulnerability:
- is present in the latest version
- allows for RCE vulnerabilities
- AND has been caused by my own code:

All affected versions will be patched ASAP. Please report those vulnerabilities, as well as steps on how to reproduce them, to The Untitled Team as soon as possible!
