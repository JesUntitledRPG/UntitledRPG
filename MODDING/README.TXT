Hello! It's me, Jes. I suppose you either wanted to modify Untitled RPG Game and noticed this, thinking it was some sort of API, or you were searching the game files for eastereggs.
Well, I'm here to inform you that there's no API yet. Don't know how to make it. But, in the meantime, there's still ways to mod Untitled RPG Game! Most of them WILL require manual compilation into binaries, though...

Right now, you should check the guides stored here. The easiest things to mod in should be:

- custom enemies
- custom items
- custom maps

Try adding an item first. It's a good stepping stone, since you only need to check the ITEMMARKUPLANG.txt file to read what you need to do.

From there, try adding custom enemies, and, if you feel like working hard on a map, make one too.

Bon voyage!

- Jes

Install Guide

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install the lastest version of Python from the python.org website.
2. Install pip, and install the latest release of pygame-ce from the Python Package Index. If any errors arise, install an older version of pygame-ce until one works.
3. Go the Untitled RPG Game GitHub. It should be located at https://www.github.com/JesUntitledRPG/UntitledRPG at the time of writing. If any notices of a transferred repository of some kind appear on the project description or README,
   follow the next step using the files from that repository.
4. Open up the main.py file with your IDE of choice. Any IDE should work, although I've personally only used Visual Studio Code and PyCharm, although IDLE or any other IDE that works on Python should be able to do the trick.
5. Have fun tinkering around the codebase.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need to compile your binaries, use pyinstaller. It'll compile to your device's OS. By that, we mean that it will compile into your OS's binary/application format. (Windows -> *.exe, MacOS -> *.app, etc.)

Compiling for mobile has a completely different process. Read the python-for-android and Kivy documentations for help with that.
