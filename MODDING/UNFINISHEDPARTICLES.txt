PARTICLE GUIDE:

The particle system is quite complicated. Here's a guide on how to use it.

1. Call ParticleSpawner with your chosen upon parameters. You should know what an image is, and hardcoded x and y are just that; hardcoded x and y values, which you can just set to zero if you don't care about them,
and you can choose any list dedicated to particles to append them in, but the TYPE system is what you'll probably be stuck on. Here's a quick explaination.

	1. The starting portion of your particle type defines it's Base Type: Standard, or Rotating.
	2. After that, you should put in your orientation. Right now it's just typing in RighttoLeft or DowntoUp, but an angling system should be added in the future.
	3. Add the variations now. VariedScale, VariedRotation, VariedX and VariedY are the current ones. Scale changes the image's scale randomly, while the others just offset the Rotation, X and Y values by a random interval.
